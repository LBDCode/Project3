# Recipedia | Recipe Finder & Meal Prep Manager

Recipedia is a full-stack collaboration project that aims to make the process of
finding recipes, planning meals, and grocery shopping lists easier.

A user signs up, searches for their favorite recipe, assigns it for dinner on
Wednesday, and then sends themselves an automated list of the recipe's ingredients
to their phone/email. _It's that easy!_
